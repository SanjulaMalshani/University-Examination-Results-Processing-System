# 🚀 University Examination Results Processing System

As part of my **3rd Year, 2nd Semester Mini Project** at the  
*Department of Physical Sciences and Technology, Faculty of Applied Science, Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka*,  
I developed a **University Examination Results Automated System**.

## 🔹 Problem Addressed
Many universities still rely on **manual result processing**, which is:
- ⏳ Time-consuming  
- ❌ Error-prone  
- 🔒 Lacking transparency

## 🔹 Solution
Our system **automates the entire examination result workflow**:  
From **submission → verification → final publication**, ensuring:  
✔️ Accuracy  
✔️ Transparency  
✔️ Efficiency

## 🔹 Key Features
- ✅ Automated verification & GPA calculation  
- ✅ Secure and transparent result handling  
- ✅ Real-time access for students and faculty  
- ✅ Faster result publication with reduced errors

## 🔹 Technologies Used
- ⚛️ **React JS** (Frontend)  
- 🌱 **Spring Boot** (Backend)  
- 🍃 **MongoDB** (Database)

## 📌 Learning Outcome
This project allowed me to apply my skills in **full-stack web development** while solving a **real-world university-level problem**.
